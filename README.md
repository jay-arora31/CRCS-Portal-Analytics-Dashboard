## Hackathon Problem Statement: Creation of dashboard for CRCS portal
The Central Registrar for Cooperative Societies (CRCS) is responsible for registering and 
regulating multistate cooperative societies in India, in accordance with the MSCS Act of 2002. 
As part of this hackathon, the task is to design and develop a comprehensive dashboard for the 
upcoming new CRCS portal that will streamline the registration process, handle amendments and 
appeals, and manage annual returns for the registered societies.
